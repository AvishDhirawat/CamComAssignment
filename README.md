CamCom Assignment for QC Person
In a manual QC (Quality Check) process, there is a portal from which each individual QC task is assigned. 
The portal needs to check how many QC persons are logged in and which of the logged in persons are free, as in not on a task, and automatically assign tasks. 
Once the task is finished the person will automatically get assigned the next task if any is pending. 
How would you architect this? I want to understand step by step the methodology you used to come to the final solution. 
Illustrate a basic API framework written in Python using Flask and MySql as the database.
